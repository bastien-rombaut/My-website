<h2>Geography of Guinea-Conakry</h2>
<p>Guinea-Conakry is a country in West Africa known for its diverse geography, including coastal plains, mountains, and savanna. Its capital is Conakry. The country is divided into four geographic regions: the narrow coastal belt; the pastoral Fouta Djallon highland region, with elevations averaging 1,000 feet above sea level; the hotter, drier upper Guinea savanna region; and the tropical rainforest in the southeast.
<br>
<br>
Guinea has a lovely and varied landscape. The coastal region includes 320 kilometers of coastline and offers beautiful offshore islands, remote beaches, and mangrove swamps; the highland region encompasses verdant hills and stunning waterfalls; and the southeastern region contains ancient and beautiful forests and Guinea's highest point, the 1,752-meter high Mount Nimba.</p>

<h2>Guinean Culture</h2>
<p>Guinea’s culture is layered and interesting, inhabited by a wide range of ethnic groups, each with their own distinct traditions and many variations in language. Despite these differences, Guineans are predominantly Muslim, adhering to the teachings and religious observances of Islam. 
<br>
<br>
Among the major ethnic groups in the country are Peuhl or Fula (in the Fouta Djalon region), the Maninka (in the forests and savannahs of Upper Guinea), Susus (in Conakry), and smaller groups like Toma, Kissis, Kpelle, and Gerzé (in the forests and coastal areas).
<br>
<br>
Music is one of the biggest aspects of Guinean culture, and locals celebrate a lot of festivals to commemorate this prevalent art form. Guineans play a wide range of string and percussion instruments, including the ngoni, balafon, kora (a hybrid of a lute and harp), and the guitar. Folk music is also accompanied by dunun, paired with the djembe (drums).</p>
