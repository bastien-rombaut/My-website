<h2>Geography of Peru</h2>
<p>Peru is the third largest country in South America, after Brazil and Argentina. It is made up of a variety of landscapes, from mountains and beaches to deserts and rain forests. Most people live along the coast of the Pacific Ocean, where the capital, Lima, is located.
<br>
<br>
Along Peru's west coast is a narrow strip of desert 1,555 miles (2,500 kilometers) long. Ancient people, called the Chimú and the Nasca, first inhabited this region thousands of years ago. The coastal desert makes up only about 10 percent of Peru, but it is home to more than half of all Peruvians.
<br>
<br>
The world's largest rain forest, the Amazon, covers nearly half of Peru. Called the selva in Spanish, this huge jungle, which also covers half of Brazil, is home to plants and animals that do not live anywhere else on Earth. Some scientists think there may even be Indian tribes there that have never seen the outside world.
<br>
<br>
The second highest mountain range in the world runs through Peru. These peaks, called the Andes, are so tall and forbidding that the ancient Inca people thought they were gods. They run from north to south and can be seen from Peru's beaches 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the west. The highest peak, Mount Huascarán, is 22,205 feet (6,768 meters) high.</p>

<h2>Peruvian Culture</h2>
<p>Peruvian culture is a beautiful mix of Hispanic and native traditions. The Quechua and the Aymara are the two main native cultures of Peru, both of whom speak their native languages. These Inca descendants have successfully preserved and developed their proud cultures despite the creeping in of globalization. In fact, the old Inca seat of Cuzco is still perceived as the cultural capital of the country by many.
<br>
<br>
Peruvian typical dress is beautiful. In some regions, the women wear layers of bright skirts called polleras. Some wear black skirts with a wide embroidered belt, or cotton petticoats underneath with elaborate designs. Peruvian ponchos are a necessity in the highlands, where the cold can be harsh; the ponchos of Cajamarca and Puno are long and dramatic, where as those of Cuzco are shorter. Woolen or straw hats are also common.</p>

<h2>Tourist Attractions</h2>
<p>Tourism in Peru is the third-largest industry in the country. It contributes approximately 7% of the country’s GDP. And is mainly developed at the different archaeological sites of interest, at the Peruvian Amazon and the northern beaches. Although the entire country has much more to offer the country. 
<br>
<br>
Peru is visited by more than 4 million visitors per year, and the number grows astronomically each time. The majority of them choose to travel directly to Cusco to visit the renowned Machu Picchu and thus take advantage of their time in Peru to visit alternative and no less important destinations in the country. Arequipa, Puno, northern beaches, and Lima are some of the destinations that you will not want to miss during your journey.
